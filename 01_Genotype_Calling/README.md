## Genotype calling

#### Part 1: Scripts to process whole genome short-read Illumina sequence data (fastq -> BAM -> gVCF).

For each sample, sequentially run WGSproc steps 1-7 to trim, map, and call genotypes per individual. 

For any questions regarding this content, please contact Jacqueline Robinson (https://jarobinsonresearch.com). 


#### Part 2: Filter merged genotype calls to produce files of anubis and yellow baboon genotype calls, as well as a callset merged with the Amboseli data.
