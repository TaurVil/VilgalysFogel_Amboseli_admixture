## Local Ancestry Calling

Analyses in our manuscript primarily use local ancestry calls generated by LCLAE (Wall et al. 2016 *Molecular Ecology*; https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.13684, https://github.com/jdwall02/LCLAE), which is described in part 1 of this directory. However, we also sought to make sure LCLAE-based ancestry calls were accurate and concordant with other methods. We checked our ancestry calls in three ways. First, we simulated high and low coverage genomes and found that LCLAE was ~90% accurate in calling local ancestry and performed better on low coverage baboon data than other programs (part 2). Second, we used mother-father-offspring trios from the Amboseli baboons to identify local ancestry calls which were inconsistent given the pedigree structure (part 3). Finally, we estimated genome-wide anubis ancestry proportions of Amboseli baboons with high coverage data using _F4_-ratio estimation (Patterson et al. 2012 _Genetics_) (part 4).
