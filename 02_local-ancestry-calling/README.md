## Local Ancestry Calling

Most analyses in this manuscript use local ancestry calls determined by LCLAE, the pipeline for which is described in part 1 of this directory. However, before doing so we sought to make sure ancestry calls were accurate and concordant with other methods. We checked accuracy in two ways. First, we simulated high and low coverage genomes and found that LCLAE was ~90% accurate in calling local ancestry and performed better on low coverage baboon data than other programs (part 2). These results are summarized in the text and Figure S2. Second, we used mother-father-offspring trios of Amboseli baboons to identify local ancestry calls which were impossible given the pedigree structure (part 3, e.g. homozygous anubis parents producing an offspring with a yellow allele). Low rates of pedigree inconsistency suggest that LCLAE provided accurate local ancestry calls. Finally, We also confirmed our estimates of genome-wide ancestry in Amboseli baboons using F4 statistics (Patterson et al. 2012) (part 4).
