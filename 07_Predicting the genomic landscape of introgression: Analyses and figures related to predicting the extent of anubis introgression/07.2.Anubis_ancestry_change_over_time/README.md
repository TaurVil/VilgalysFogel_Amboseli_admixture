## This directory contains an R script for evaluating whether genomic features predict the rate of change in anubis allele frequencies over time (Supplementary Methods 14.2).

#### The R script, 1anubis_ancestry_change_over_time.R, requires two data sets, "XXX TPV 100 kb window files XXX TPV will upload a clean version" and "amboseli.demographic.info.txt", which are available in the Duke Data Repository at XXXXXXXXX.
* **TPV 100 kb window data files**: includes anubis ancestry generated using masked SNPRC individuals for the reference panel (used in main text analyses) in 100 kb windows across the genome (excluding the 50 kb at the chromosome ends) for all Amboseli individuals, mean recombination rate in 100 kb windows (which has already removed windows in which recombination rate estimates were greater than 100x larger than the median recombination rate), and B values in 100 kb windows. 
* **amboseli.demographic.info.txt**: contains demographic data for Amboseli individuals with confirmed ids, including the starting and endings years they were present in the population. Note that other demographic data used in other scripts are also included in this data frame but which we won't use here (their sex, entry type (B = born into a study group, O = first observed in a new study group, or I = immigrating into a study group), genome_wide_anubis_ancestry)

#### The R script also requires estimates of FST, mean recombination rate, and B-values. 
* **FST**: to get these estimates, use the script 4bFST_SNPRCref.sh in "VilgalysFogel_Amboseli_admixture/02_Local ancestry calling/02.3.pedigree_trios/" but substituting 00000 for window size --fst-window-size in place of 35000.
