This repository contains materials used to analyze the data from, and recreate the results in, Vilgalys, Fogel, et al. currently under review. These scripts include: 

1. **Genotype calling**: Scripts for trimming, mapping, and calling genotype data.

2. **Local ancestry calling**: Local ancestry calling, including verifying our approach through simulation and quality control measures. 

3. **Genomic resources for baboons**: Annotation of the baboon genome, expanding upon data available from Batra et al. 2020. 

4. **Structure of the baboon hybrid zone**: Analyses and figures related to the extent of admixture beyond the Amboseli hybrid zone. 

5. **Selection against introgression in Amboseli**: Analyses and figured related to selection against anubis baboon ancestry in Amboseli baboons. 

6. **Selection against regulatory divergence**: Analyses and figures related to ancestry-associated expression, and selection against those regions.  

7. **Predicting the genomic landscape of introgression**: Analyses and figures related to predicting the extent of anubis introgression. 

Finally, we include here a RData file (`VilgalysFogel_main_data_file.250kb.RData`) which contains estimates of mean anubis ancestry for 250kb windows and genes across the baboon genome. This data file is produced in Section 05.
