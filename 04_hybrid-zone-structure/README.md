## Structure of the baboon hybrid zone

While we know that Amboseli resides in an active hybrid zone between yellow and anubis baboons, it is possible that even yellow and anubis baboons far from the currently known hybrid zone may contain considerable heterospecific ancestry. For example, an anubis baboon sampled from the Aberdares region (far from the known hybrid zone) is believed to contain considerably yellow baboon ancestry (Rogers et al. 2019). 

This directory contains three complementary analyses designed to explore the structure and extent of the yellow-anubis hybrid zone. We find evidence that the "yellow" baboons used to found the SNPRC colony contain anubis admixture similar to Amboseli baboons. We also find evidence that gene flow in Amboseli has occurred over an extended period with the timing of admixture per individual ranging from 5 to over 600 generations ago. 

1. **Principal component analyses** to explore the genetic similarity between the different baboon populations we sampled. 
2. **IBDmix** which is a reference-free method to detect shared ancestry between samples without assuming that any individuals are unadmixed. 
3. **DATES** which is used to estimate the timing of gene flow between yellow and anubis baboons. 

Each of these directories includes an additional README describing the analyses in more detail and providing the data and scripts to recapitulate figures and the main results.
