## Structure of the baboon hybrid zone

The Amboseli baboon population has been documented as part of the yellow-anubis baboon hybrid zone in East Africa for several decades (Samuels & Altmann 1986 _International Journal of Primatology_; Tung et al. 2008 _Molecular Ecology_; Charpentier et al. 2012 _Molecular Ecology_; Wall et al. 2016 _Molecular Ecology_). We analyzed the ancestry of yellow and anubis baboons far from the currently known hybrid zone to explore the extent of admixture in this region. Previous work has shown that an anubis baboon sampled from the Aberdares region in central Kenya (far from the known hybrid zone) likely contains considerably yellow baboon ancestry (Rogers et al. 2019 _Science Advances_). 

This directory contains three complementary analyses that explore the structure and extent of the yellow-anubis baboon hybrid zone. We find evidence that the "yellow" baboons used to found the SNPRC colony contain anubis admixture similar to historically admixed Amboseli baboons. We also find evidence that gene flow in Amboseli has occurred over an extended period with the timing of admixture per individual ranging from 5 to over 600 generations ago. 

1. **Principal component analyses** to explore the genetic similarity between the different baboon populations we sampled. 
2. **IBDmix**, a reference-free method, to detect shared ancestry between samples without assuming that any individuals are unadmixed. 
3. **DATES** is used to estimate the timing of gene flow between yellow and anubis baboons. 

Each of these directories includes an additional README describing the analyses in more detail and providing the data and scripts to recapitulate figures and the main results.
