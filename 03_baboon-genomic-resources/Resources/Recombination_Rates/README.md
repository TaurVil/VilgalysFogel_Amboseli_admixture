Recombination rates, by chromosome, for the anubis baboon genome (Panubis1). Recombination rates were inferred using LDhelmet and data for 24 unadmixed anubis baboons from Robinson et al. 2019.

Code for calling the recombination rates is available in https://github.com/TaurVil/VilgalysFogel_Amboseli_admixture/tree/main/03_genomic_resources_for_baboons/02_recombination_map
