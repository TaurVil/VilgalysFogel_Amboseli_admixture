Recombination rates, by chromosome, for the anubis baboon genome (_Panubis1_). Recombination rates were inferred using LDhelmet and data for 24 unadmixed anubis baboons from Robinson et al. 2019 _Genome Research_.

Code for calling the recombination rates is available in https://github.com/TaurVil/VilgalysFogel_Amboseli_admixture/tree/main/03_baboon-genomic-resources/scripts/
